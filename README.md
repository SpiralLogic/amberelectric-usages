# Amber Electric Usages

This is a data update coordinator for Amber Electric subscribers. Some subscribers (e.g. residents of NSW) are usually not able to get live data from smart meters and the data is often delay-ed by one day, and therefore the mechanism of a typical HA sensor doesn't work. This custom component takes a different approach to populate the data as statistics to HA, which can also be used in energy dashboard.

This is an addition and does not replace the mainstream Amber Electric sensor in HA core.
